# Pixiv Hide Works

Firefox add-on that conceals works that you don't like on Pixiv.

The extension only works with artworks and manga - not with novels.

The extension doesn't make any additional requests and uses all the janky logic
to determine work tags. I couldn't account for everything, but it's fine for me.

If the extension couldn't determine if a work should be hidden, a little question
mark will appear in the bottom left corner of the illustration.
